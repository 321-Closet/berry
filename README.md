# berry-tsü´ê

berry-ts, is the typescript rewrite of the berry ROBLOX game framework. With berry's vision to support
as many different groups of users as possible, berry supports the use of ROBLOX-TS, this version of berry
is completely standalone from the LUAU edition and requires no dependacies from LUAU.

To set up berry-ts:
- Install ROBLOX-TS in a relevant directory
- Install Rojo and call 'rojo serve' in a new terminal
- git clone berry into the directory, and you have access to all of the typescript versions of berry code base

Note:
Support for berry-ts is continuous but slower than standard berry, if getting the latest
updates for the framework is the most important thing for you then it's safe to recommend that you
use standard berry.
